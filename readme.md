A little web space for self-expression. A continuous front-end experiment, following the rigorous principles of JDD, or joy-driven development. Merrily made using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

## Running locally

Install dependencies:

`npm i -g create-elm-app`
`yarn install`

Run development server (things are still a bit manual to work around `create-elm-app`):

`npm run copy`
`npm run watchcss`
`elm-app start`
