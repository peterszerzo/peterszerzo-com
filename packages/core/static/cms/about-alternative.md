Oh, good, you hit the magic switch. Let me balance out the somewhat conformist professionalism on the other page with some real Peter Szerzo.

I’m caring, fun and passionate, but that said, when I’m wrapped up in anxiety or self-judgement (often!), then I can be a bit too much. Ramble ramble ramble.

I overly scrutinize my spending decisions and I am worried about gaining weight. I also have a fear that one day, due to say world politics, I will have to return to live in Romania - a place I grew up in but no longer care for too much. Speaking of growing up: when I was 6, I hit my brother on his back with my fist so hard I felt his entire ribcage resonate through mine. I regret it to this day for the simple fact that while my adult brother can forgive me, his child version is just not around.

Let’s see what else.. I often find myself in a reflective mood. When I am having a hard time, I have a habit of asking myself: ‘What is wrong with this moment?’ Eventually, the answer is always ‘nothing’, and the moment of realizing that is genuine happiness to me. I read that in a book, and wonder sometimes if I truly believe it or if I’m just cluelessly parroting it back.

It means a lot to me that you’ve read this.
