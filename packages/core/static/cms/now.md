Focusing on these three right now:

* Design and UI engineering for [NLX](https://nlx.ai).

* More or less weekly drawings on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peterszerzo_/).

* Prepping to go back to [school](https://filmuniversitaet.de/studium/studienangebot/masterstudiengaenge/creative-technologies/). As a shorter-term goal, passing a hairy German language test.

Enjoying podcasts like [Brought to you by](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brought-to-you-by/id1413374332) and [Oh No Ross and Carrie](http://ohnopodcast.com/). Reading [Whoâ€™s afraid of Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf%3F).
