        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>This is Peter, programmer, designer and natural language enthusiast. A friendly, straightforward fellow with eager-to-pedal feet, a green thumb and a curious mind.</p>
        <p>I make web apps, visualizations and games, spending most of my time on the frontend, sprinkled with some spent designing and some on the backend. I enjoy deleting code, shortening variable names and changing my mind about tools and frameworks. Even more so, I enjoy collaborating, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBCz6atTRZk">giving talks</a> and running workshops.</p>
        <p>Coming to tech after exploring algorithmic/computational design strategies in architecture, I love poking around across disciplines, and use code for <a href="http://splytlight.surge.sh">architecture/product design</a>, jewelry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwExBCCFdZw">animation</a> and computational art. And to get a break of them all, I read, write, do yoga and garden. All great things!</p>
        <p>You can find me on my bike on the streets of Berlin and New York, sitting around in a coffee shop, various frontend, React and Elm meetups, here and there online. Let’s talk!</p>

        <p>Oh, good, you hit the magic switch. Let me balance out the somewhat conformist professionalism on the other page with some real Peter Szerzo.</p>
        <p>I’m a great guy: caring, fun, passionate. That said, when I’m wrapped up in anxiety or self-judgement (which is often), then I can be a bit too much. Ramble ramble ramble.</p>
        <p>I tend to overly scrutinize my spending decisions and I have a light towards moderate fear of gaining weight. I also have a fear that one day, due to say world politics, I will have to return to live in Romania - a place I grew up in but no longer have strong emotional ties to. Speaking of growing up, when I was 6, I hit my brother on his back with my fist so hard I felt his entire ribcage resonate through mine. I regret it to this day. Thing is, while my adult brother can forgive me, his child version is just not around.</p>
        <p>Let’s see what else.. I often find myself in a reflective mood. I have a habit of asking myself: ‘What is wrong with this moment?’ Eventually, the answer is always ‘nothing’, and the moment of realizing that is genuine happiness to me. I read that in a book, and wonder sometimes if I truly believe it or if I’m just cluelessly parroting it back.</p>
        <p>It means a lot to me that you’ve read this.</p>
