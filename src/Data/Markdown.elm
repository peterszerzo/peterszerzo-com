aboutConventional = """
This is Peter, programmer, designer, language enthusiast, yogi, cook. A friendly, straightforward fellow with eager-to-pedal feet, a green thumb and a curious mind.

I make websites and web apps, with my strengths and heart in making beautiful, clean and swift user interfaces. I am versed in and excited about Elm, React, Redux, PostCSS, Express, Meteor, Ghost, and Rails, and know my way around Heroku and AWS (though I do prefer surge.sh). I thoroughly enjoy mentoring junior developers, giving talks and running workshops. I get a real kick out of listening and explaining, and best of all, sparking excitement both around and within me.

I love designing my own interfaces and contributing to design processes at work. I draw ok in Sketch. I am also interested in coding outside of the browser, from architectural and jewelry design to animation, computational art and natural language processing. I love reading, writing and gardening. They're great for the soul.

You can find me on my bike on the streets of Copenhagen, sitting around in a coffee shop, the local front-end, React and Elm meetups, here and there online. Let's talk!

Oh good, you hit the magic switch. Let me balance out the conformist professionalism on the other page with some real Peter Szerzo.

I'm a great guy: caring, fun, passionate. That said, when I'm wrapped up in excessive anxiety or self-judgement (which is often), then I can be a bit too much. Ramble ramble ramble.

I judge myself for spending money and I am afraid of gaining weight. I have a fear that one day, due to say world politics, I will have to return to my native Romania, a place I haven't made peace with yet. German society freaks me out.

When I was 6, I hit my brother on the back with my fist so hard I felt his entire ribcage resonate through mine. I regret it to this day. Thing is, while my adult brother can forgive me, his child version never will.

I am often in a reflective mood. When I feel really bad, I ask myself: 'What is wrong with this moment?' Eventually, the answer is always nothing, and the moment of realizing that is genuine happiness to me. The amazing circus of physical sensations in my body are always available to me, and they're incredibly powerful. They are the channel to a sense of belonging. I read all of that in a book, and wonder sometimes if I truly believe these things or just lie to myself about them.

It means a lot to me that you've read this.

The /now page is Derek Sivers' brilliant idea. Cheers, Derek!
