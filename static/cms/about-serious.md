This is Peter, programmer, designer and natural language enthusiast.

I make web apps, animations and games, spending most of my time on the frontend, sprinkled with some spent designing and some on the backend. I enjoy deleting code, shortening variable names and changing my mind about tools and frameworks. When I have things to say, I enjoy collaborating, giving talks and running workshops.

Coming to tech after exploring algorithmic/computational design strategies in architecture, I love poking around across disciplines, and use code for product design, animation and generative art. Sometimes, I do none of that and stare out the window.

You can find me on my bike on the streets of Berlin and New York, at various frontend/creative coding/Elm meetups, here and there online. Letâ€™s talk!
